# Project-2
This is the Second Project based on Machine Learning

â€¢	Credit Card Fraud Detection
1.	Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the credit card transaction dataset.
2.	 Implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to accurately classify and detect fraudulent transactions.
3.	 Evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robust fraud detection capability.

Various algorithms of machine learning are used to check the efficiency of data and make the prediction.
